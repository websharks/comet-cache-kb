Comet Cache automatically handles updating the cache in many scenarios, such as when you publish a new post, or when you change your WordPress theme. However, there may be scenarios where you need to have finer control over when the cache is cleared, such as when a plugin or theme does not include support for WordPress caching plugins.

The following examples use the [WordPress API hooks and filters](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API) system to call a custom function that itself will call the Comet Cache API to clear the cache when a specific event occurs.

### How to use the code examples

While you can add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file or use a [Functionality Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/functionality/), we recommend using a [WordPress Must-Use Plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins) by creating a file like `wp-content/mu-plugins/cc-clear-cache.php` and then adding the necessary PHP code (note that if the `mu-plugins` directory doesn't exist, you should create it).

What follows are a few examples of how you can clear the cache dynamically.

## Examples using WordPress Hooks/Filters API

### Clear entire cache when saving any post

If you want to clear the cache every time a post is saved or updated (i.e., when the `save_post` action is fired), you can use the following.

**Comet Cache Lite or Comet Cache Pro**

```php
add_action( 'save_post', 'my_custom_clear_cache', 10, 1 );

function my_custom_clear_cache( ) {
    comet_cache::clear();
}
```

### Clear page cache when Custom Post Type is saved

Using the `save_post_{$post_type}` hook, which is fired whenever that custom post type is created or updated (see [docs](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/save_post)), you can use something like the following to clear the cache for a given page whenever a post with that custom post type is saved.

**Comet Cache Lite or Comet Cache Pro**

```php
add_action( 'save_post_my-custom-post-type', 'clear_cache_for_page_id_5', 10, 1 );

function clear_cache_for_page_id_5( ) {
	comet_cache::clearPost(5); // Clears cache for Post ID 5
}
```

You'll want to change `5` to the ID of the Page/Post whose cache you'd like to clear when that custom post type is saved, and you'll want to change `my-custom-post-type` to the actual name of your Custom Post Type.

### Clear a specific URL cache when saving any post

Using the `save_post` hook, which is fired whenever a post created or updated (see [docs](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/save_post)), you can use something like the following to clear the cache for a given URL on your site.

**Comet Cache Lite or Comet Cache Pro**

```php
add_action( 'save_post', 'clear_cache_for_page_url', 10, 1 );

function clear_cache_for_page_url( ) {
	comet_cache::clearUrl('http://example.com/sample-page/'); // Clears cache for page with URL http://example.com/sample-page/
}
```

You'll want to change `http://example.com/sample-page/` to the URL of the Page/Post whose cache you'd like to clear. Note that you can also use the [Watered-Down Regex Syntax](https://cometcache.com/kb-article/watered-down-regex-syntax/) in this URL.

### Clear a specific page cache when saving any post

Using the `save_post` hook, which is fired whenever a post created or updated (see [docs](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/save_post)), you can use something like the following to clear the cache for a given page.

**Comet Cache Lite or Comet Cache Pro**

```php
add_action( 'save_post', 'clear_cache_for_page_id_5', 10, 1 );

function clear_cache_for_page_id_5( ) {
	comet_cache::clearPost(5); // Clears cache for Post ID 5
}
```

You'll want to change `5` to the ID of the Page/Post whose cache you'd like to clear.

### Clear the cache for a Logged-In User (when caching for Logged-In Users is enabled)

_**Note:** The API call used below requires Comet Cache Pro._

To clear the cache for a specific user by passing the User ID, you can use the following. The examples below clear the cache for the user with User ID `25`.

**Comet Cache Pro**

```php
add_action( 'init', 'clear_user_cache_for_id_25', 10, 1 );

function clear_user_cache_for_id_25( ) {
	comet_cache::clearUser(25); // Clears the cache for User ID 25
}
```

You'll want to change `25` to the User ID whose cache you'd like to clear.

### Clear the cache for the currently Logged-In User (when caching for Logged-In Users is enabled)

_**Note:** The API call used below requires Comet Cache Pro._

If you just want to clear the cache for the currently logged in user, you can use the following code (this uses `get_current_user_id()` to detect the User ID of the current user).

**Comet Cache Pro**

```php
add_action( 'init', 'clear_current_user_cache', 10, 1 );

function clear_current_user_cache( ) {
	comet_cache::clearCurrentUser();
}
```

## Using the Comet Cache API Class

If you need to call the Comet Cache API from another PHP file, you will first need to load the WordPress framework (via `wp-load.php`). See the examples below.

### Comet Cache Lite

```php
<?php
// Load WordPress framework
require_once dirname(__FILE__).'/wp-load.php';

// Any of these API calls can now be made from this PHP file
comet_cache::version();
comet_cache::options();
comet_cache::clear();
comet_cache::wipe();
comet_cache::purge();
```

### Comet Cache Pro

```php
<?php
// Load WordPress framework
require_once dirname(__FILE__).'/wp-load.php';

// Any of these API calls can now be made from this PHP file
comet_cache::version();
comet_cache::options();
comet_cache::clear();
comet_cache::wipe();
comet_cache::purge();
comet_cache::clearPost($post_id);
comet_cache::clearUser($user_id);
comet_cache::clearCurrentUser();
comet_cache::clearUrl($url);
```
